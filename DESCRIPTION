Description: An R-package to help prepare Fluidigm SNPtype assays (or similar assays) from
  reduced-representation library loci (for example ddRAD or RAD loci).  You pass in a
  a data frame of variable sites, a data frame of desired SNPs, and a data frame of the
  consensus sequences of each ddRAD or RAD locus, and it returns the information needed
  to order the assays.
