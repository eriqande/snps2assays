Description: An R-package to help prepare Fluidigm SNPtype assays (or similar
    assays) from reduced-representation library loci (for example ddRAD or RAD
    loci). You pass in a a data frame of variable sites, a data frame of desired
    SNPs, and a data frame of the consensus sequences of each ddRAD or RAD locus,
    and it returns the information needed to order the assays.
